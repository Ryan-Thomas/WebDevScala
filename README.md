# Modern Web Development with Scala

This is the companion code repository for the [Modern Web Development with Scala](https://leanpub.com/modern-web-development-with-scala) book published by Leanpub.

## Staring point

The [`starting-point`](https://github.com/denisftw/modern-web-scala/tree/starting-point-play-2.5.0) tag marks the initial state of a model application that is used throughout the book for demonstrating different aspects of Web development. In particular the book illustrates the following:

* Querying remote services with the `WS`client
* Using [MacWire](https://github.com/adamw/macwire) for injecting dependencies in Play 2.5
* Using [ScalikeJDBC](http://scalikejdbc.org/) for accessing PostgreSQL
* Integrating Play with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
* Working with JSON and using Play Forms API
* Using [Akka](http://akka.io/) Actors
* Using HTTP filters and action composition in Play

## Versions used

The code uses Play 2.5.0 and Scala 2.11.7 along with sbt 0.13.11.
